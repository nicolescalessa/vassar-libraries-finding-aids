			<head>Biographical Note </head>
			<p>The daughter of a Russian Jewish landowner and businessman, Angelica Balabanoff rebelled at a young age against her upper middle-class upbringing. She earned a doctorate at the Universite Nouvelle in Brussels and began her lifelong commitment to the socialist movement. After joining the Italian Socialist Party she worked for the party in Switzerland, where she befriended Benito Mussolini. His break with socialism and espousal of fascism deeply disappointed and angered Balabanoff.</p>
			<p>While not a great theoretician, Balabanoff was well respected in the European socialist and labor movements. She was secretary to the Zimmerwald movement, and following the Bolshevik revolution, was named Secretary of the Third Communist International in 1919. A few years later she broke with the Bolsheviks, protesting the Comintern's treatment of the Italian socialists. Emigrating first to Sweden, she began writing poetry. During World War II she lived in the United States but returned to Italy after the war. Until her death she continued to hope and work for a socialist future.</p>
