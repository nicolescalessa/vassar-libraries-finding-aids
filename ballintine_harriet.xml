			<head>Biographical Note </head>
			<p>A pioneer in the field of physical education for women, Harriet Ballintine was born 23 December 1864 in LeRoy, NY near Rochester. She graduated Ingham University in LeRoy in 1888, attended the first class in athletics for women at Harvard's summer school in 1889, studied in Europe, and graduated from the Sargent School of Physical training in Cambridge, MA. She taught at Ingham University and Lasell Seminary prior to coming to Vassar in 1891 as Director of the Gymnasium. Upon the formation of the Physical Training department in 1913, she was made assistant professor. At the same time the department was renamed Physical Education in 1919, Ballintine was made an assistant professor, which was her rank until her retirement in 1930. She died after a brief illness on 10 February 1951 at age 86. For more information, see the Faculty Biographical Files, VC Department of Archives and Special Collections</p>
