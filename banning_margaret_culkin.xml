			<head>Biographical Note</head>
			<p>Writer Margaret Culkin Banning was born in Buffalo, Minnesota, and traveled east to Vassar College, where she was graduated in 1912. Following training in social work she went to Duluth, and in 1914 married Archibald Tanner Banning. Six years later her novel, This Marrying, was published, beginning a writing career that has spanned more than fifty years. Mrs. Banning's numerous novels are romances that address social problems and reflect her concern with women's role in American life. A contributor to the women's and general magazines, she has also written stories and essays dealing with the Roman Catholic Church's positions on marriage and birth control. A Catholic herself, Mrs. Banning had four children, two of whom died at a young age. In 1944 she married her second husband, LeRoy Salsich. </p>
			<p>Margaret Culkin Banning has also been active in public affairs. She served as a trustee of Vassar College (1937-1945), carried out relief work in both world wars, and was frequently heard on social issues such as chastity and pornography. While Mrs. Banning supports many traditionally feminist causes, she has also written that "if a woman is going to make a man happy, she must let him be head of the house." </p>
			<p>Banning died in 1982. </p>
