			<head>Biographical Note </head>
			<p>Louise Hunting Seaman Bechtel (1894-1985), a girl from Brooklyn, graduated from Vassar College in 1915. After teaching young children at Miss Glendinning's School in New Haven, Connecticut, for three years, she worked for a year in various departments at the Macmillan Company. Now known for her enterprising work in the field of children's literature, Bechtel began in 1919 the first children's book department in an American publishing house. Bertha Mahony Miller wrote, "in the year 1919 two important and far reaching events occurred in the publishing of children's books for young people:--(1) The Macmillan Company created a separate children's department; and (2) the President of the firm, Mr. George P. Brett, one of the ablest and wisest men in the publishing profession, selected the peculiarly right young woman as head of the new department."</p>
			<p>During the next fifteen years, her work for Macmillan expanded to include sales trips across America, wide lecturing, and much writing about children's literature. During that time, she spoke at a conference at Vassar on children's reading. In some years, her catalogs held as many as fifty or sixty new titles. Three of the books she published, THE TRUMPETER OF KRAKOW, THE CAT WHO WENT TO HEAVEN, AND HITTY, HER FIRST HUNDRED YEARS, were awarded the Newbury Medal.</p>
			<p>Louise Bechtel viewed book publishing as a profession, rather than as a trade. Her well-known book catalogs were full of photographs, color illustrations, and quotations about her authors. She was determined that there be "no childish books...nothing which will have to be outgrown." When Bechtel was compelled to resign from Macmillan Company in 1934 because of a broken hip, her closest friend, Elizabeth Coatsworth (VC 1915), wrote: "In everything she was a pioneer with a pioneer's infectious vigor and high spirits. Hers was a great gift of making writing exciting and rewarding in itself, and something went out of publishing when she retired."</p>
			<p>Although she was no longer active as a publisher, Bechtel continued her involvement in the field of children's literature as a member of the first committee for the first Children's Book Week and as a Fellow of the Pierpoint Morgan Library; she also served on a number of juries of the American Institute of Graphic arts. In the summer of 1940 and 1941 she taught Writing for Children at the Rocky Mountain Writer's Conference, University of Colorado, Boulder. Between 1949 and 1956, Louise Bechtel worked as editor of the "Books for Young People" section of the NEW YORK HERALD TRIBUNE. In addition, she wrote about books for the Library of Congress' UNITED STATES QUARTERLY BOOK REVIEW, the SATURDAY REVIEW, THE BOOKMAN, THE NEW YORK TIMES, and THE HORN BOOK, for which she served as associate editor and, later, director.</p>
			<p>In February 1929, Louise Hunting Seaman married Edwin (Ned) de Turck Bechtel, an attorney for the American Express Company. They made their home in Bedford, New York, where Louise Bechtel gathered her collection of children's books. Louise Bechtel maintained an active interest in the Bedford community where she served as a trustee of the local library; there she founded and directed the St. Matthew's Church School. Both Mr. and Mrs. Bechtel were devoted to the family dachshund, Mr. Nathaniel Winkle, and to raising roses, traveling, and playing host to the troupe of young visitors who came to hear stories and borrow books.</p>

			<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
			<p>The Louise Seaman Bechtel Collection primarily concerns Bechtel's work in literature, publishing, and editing, especially for children, and includes correspondence, manuscripts, illustrations, biographical information, and published articles and reviews from or pertaining to authors, illustrators, and publishers. The collection documents both her professional and personal life. The materials, such as scrapbooks, letters, original manuscripts, photographs, clippings and other unique ephemera provide a solid background of the late publisher/editor.</p>
			<p>An extensive correspondence documents years of friendship and professional affiliations with such notable authors and illustrators as Margery and Pamela Bianco, Padraic Colum, Anne Carroll Moore, Bertha Mahony Miller, and Katharine Sergeant Angell White. There is also significant material relating to Elizabeth Coatsworth, Vassar classmate and children's author, such as correspondence concerning travel, writing, mutual friends, the onset of World War II, volunteer war work, and family news, 1913-1980; biographical articles on Coatsworth, 1936-1978; and a Coatsworth family photograph album, 1898-1979.</p>
			<p>Other correspondents include: Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens, May Lamberton Becker, Harry Behn, Margaret Wise Brown, Alice Dalgliesh, Thomas Handforth, Susan Hirschman, Alfred Knopf, Anne Parrish, Frances Clarke Sayers, Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and Sara Teasdale.</p>
			<p>There are also letters from editors and board members at the Horn Book Company, publishers of THE HORN BOOK MAGAZINE and other children's literature, concerning Bechtel's work, editorial policy, conflicts between editors and the board, and publishing plans, with some personal and family news, 1934-1974. Correspondents include Bertha E. Mahony (Miller), Jennie D. Linquist, and Ruth Hill Viguers.</p>
			<p>Other items include scrapbooks of Bechtel's published reviews and articles; typed excerpts from the diary of her father Charles F. Seaman, 1877-1950; family photographs, clippings, announcements, and postcards; and Bechtel's collection of prints and photographs including works by Boris Artzybasheff, Pamela Bianco, Fritz Eichenberg, Dorothy Lathrop, Howard Pyle, Lynd Ward, and Stow Wengenroth.</p>

			<head> Related Materials</head>
			<p>The Vassar College Archives and Special Collections Library hold the Bechtel Children's Book Collection, which includes outstanding late nineteenth and twentieth century children's books numbering in the thousands, ranging from a mint-condition German children's book from the era of the Weimar Republic--its inserts, pop-up pages, and tissuey windows begging to be handled--to a well thumbed copy of Collodi's PINOCHIO. During her extensive travels abroad, Bechtel became an avid collector of children's books from foreign lands. There are some two hundred or more titles published in France, Germany, Sweden, England, the Soviet Union, Japan, India, and other countries. Among the more familiar of these titles are a Danish edition of Andersen's THE PRINCESS AND THE PEA, and a French edition of deBrunhoff's Babar series. Works of noted nineteenth and twentieth century English and American children's book illustrators are also included: Arthur Rackham, Kate Greenaway, Walter Crane,
				Randolph Caldecott, Beatrix Potter, Boris Artzybasheff, Dorothy Pulis Lathrop, Rachel Lyman Field, James Daugherty, Helen Sewell, Pamela Bianco, Fritz Eichenberg, Howard Pyle and Lynd Ward are among those represented. Most of these books once belonged to "Mr. Winkle's Room," the library of approximately 3500 volumes in Bechtel's home in Bedford. The books in this collection can be accessed through the Vassar College Library's on-line catalog. </p>
