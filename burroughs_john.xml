			<head>Biographical Note</head>
			<p>John Burroughs (1837-1921) is one of most important contributors to the canon of
				American nature writing and was one of the most well-known essayists of his time. He
				published widely on a variety of subjects in many popular publications, received
				numerous awards and honorary degrees and was well known to scholars and laypeople
				alike. However, his popularity waned after his death and only recently has interest
				in his work been rekindled. His work is of significance to those studying not just
				natural history, but also ecology, philosophy, poetry, geography, history and many
				other areas.</p>
			<p>Burroughs was born on a dairy farm in Roxbury, New York, in the heart of the Catskill
				Mountains. As a child he spent much of his spare time reading and writing. He
				attended various one-room school houses and, for a short time, attended the Hedding
				Literary Institute in Ashland, New York as well as the Cooperstown Seminary. He left
				home at seventeen to become a teacher himself, and took posts at rural schools in
				New York, New Jersey, and Illinois. Throughout, he continued to hone his skills as a
				writer. Burroughs' earliest journal dates from 1854 when he was 17, but the first
				form he explored as a public writer (due in part to his love of the work of Samuel
				Johnson and Ralph Waldo Emerson) was the essay. "Fragments from the Table of an
				Intellectual Epicure," appeared in the <emph render="italic">The New York Saturday
					Press</emph> in 1860. His first significant published piece, "Expression" was
				accepted by <emph render="italic">Atlantic Monthly</emph> later that same year, but
				because the <emph render="italic">Atlantic</emph> articles were not signed at that
				point, many, including the editor, mistook the author for Emerson. Soon his work was
				being published in some of the most popular magazines of the day. He was not,
				however, able to depend on his writing as a primary source of income for another 25
				years.</p>
			<p>Burroughs married Ursula North in 1857 and with her encouragement, made the decision
				to leave teaching to pursue more lucrative work as a clerk for the U.S. Treasury.
				The couple moved to Washington, D.C. in 1863. While there Burroughs became
				acquainted with another new arrival, Walt Whitman. The two became fast friends as
				well as significant influences on each others' work. Burrough's first book,
				published in 1867, was a defense of the controversial poet: <emph render="underline"
					>Notes on Walt Whitman as Poet and Person</emph>.</p>
			<p>In 1873, Burroughs left Washington to return home to New York as a bank examiner. He
				built his home "Riverby" on a vineyard in West Park, a small town on the Hudson
				River only 50 miles from his birthplace. In 1881 he constructed his "Bark Study"
				just off the main house, a quiet retreat (perhaps away from the watchful eye of Mrs.
				Burroughs, who disapproved of his writing) where he added to his growing body of
				essays and full length works (see list below). His work garnered substantial popular
				and critical acclaim, and by 1885 he was able to give up the bank position and fully
				devote his time to writing and enjoying his land.</p>
			<p>Burroughs also enjoyed spending time with his young son, Julian. The couple adopted
				the child when he was two months old, but Ursula was unaware that her husband had a
				biological connection to the boy. The child's parentage was somewhat obscure while
				Burroughs' lived, but the truth was that Julian was John's son. The details
				eventually came out and there was some family tension, but both parents adored
				Julian, and the family maintained a close bond.</p>
			<p>In 1895, Burroughs built another retreat, this time a mile away from the Riverby
				house, where it was becoming increasingly difficult to work because of the steady
				flow of expected (and some unexpected) guests. Still, some visitors were welcome at
				his new woodland cabin. Family and local friends made the trip out to "Slabsides,"
				including some of his more prominent acquaintances, such as Theodore Roosevelt and
				Henry Ford. It was also a favorite field trip for Vassar College people,
				particularly his young friends in the Wake-Robin Club.</p>
			<p>Although John Burroughs spent the greater portion of his life within a small radius
				in New York State, his contact with the world at large was extensive. His travels
				took him to England, the West Indies, Bermuda, and Hawaii. In the United States he
				went north to Alaska, south to Georgia, east to New England, and west to California.
				In 1899 he cruised with the Harriman Expedition to Alaska along with John Muir and
				others, and in 1903 he traveled with President Roosevelt to Yellowstone National
				Park.</p>
			<p>In 1901, Burroughs met Dr. Clara Barrus, a psychiatrist and admirer of his work. They
				became friends and eventually she served as his assistant and traveling companion.
				She also became close with Mrs. Burroughs. In 1914, Barrus moved into a house at
				Riverby, and when Ursula's health began to fail, the couple stayed with her. Ursula
				died in 1917 from cancer. Burroughs remained active and continued to write, but he
				followed Ursula four years later. He died on a train returning from a winter stay in
				California. Barrus, who became his literary executor, published his last essays in
					<emph render="underline">Under the Maples</emph> (1921) and <emph
					render="underline">The Last Harvest</emph> (1922).</p>

			<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
			<p>Vassar's John Burroughs collection consists of journals and some correspondence, as
				well as published and unpublished materials and photographs relating to the
				naturalist's personal and professional life. The journals are a significant
				component of the collection. There are 53 handwritten volumes (circa 3,300 leaves)
				kept by Burroughs between 13 May 1876, and 4 February 1921. The volumes contain his
				observations on nature as well as the political, literary, and philosophical
				commentary, which became the basis for many of his essays. The collection also
				includes two sets of transcriptions of the journals. The first, annotated and edited
				by Clara Barrus, covers the journals in the Vassar collection (1876-1921) as well as
				earlier volumes located in the Berg Collection at the New York Public Library
				(1854-1876). These transcripts were prepared for the 1928 Barrus publication, <emph
					render="underline">The Heart of John Burroughs's Journals</emph>. The second
				transcription was prepared by Elizabeth Burroughs Kelley, granddaughter of John
				Burroughs and author of several works about him, and includes her handwritten
				annotations.</p>
			<p>Other writings in the collection include manuscript as well has published versions of
				Burroughs short and full-length works. Much of the manuscript material was annotated
				in some way by either Clara Barrus or Elizabeth Burroughs Kelley. The same is true
				for the published versions, and it appears that many items in that series were
				collected by Elizabeth Burroughs Kelley while doing research on her grandfather.</p>
			<p>The correspondence is divided into incoming, outgoing and a miscellaneous series. In
				both incoming and outgoing, the most frequent correspondents are Burroughs' wife
				Ursula and his son Julian. Other correspondents include friends, family, neighbors,
				professional contacts as well as readers of Burroughs' work. Several well-known
				friends and acquaintances of Burroughs are represented, such as Walt Whitman and
				Theodore Roosevelt. There are letters to and from artists, such as Timothy Cole,
				Pietro, and Orlando Rouland, a Burroughs portraitist. There are also several letters
				showing the connection between Burroughs and members of the Vassar College
				community, among them: Georgia Avery Kendrick, Clara S. Reed, James Monroe Taylor,
				and Mary W. Whitney. A series of letters between Fanny Borden, Vassar College Head
				Librarian, and May Cline, a friend of Burroughs, chronicles the sale of some
				Burroughs letters to Clara Barrus.</p>
			<p>In addition to material created by Burroughs, there is also a variety of materials
				collected by Kelley and Barrus for their own biographical works on the writer.
				Series VII and VIII include family and personal documents belonging to Burroughs and
				the Burroughs family, but also a number of items gathered after Burroughs' death
				which provide information about his life, his work, the people he knew, and his
				impact on the world. Included are newspaper clippings, published and unpublished
				articles, postcards, correspondence and other materials collected as late as
				1991.</p>

					<p>The incoming correspondence is divided into four sections: family, Clara
						Barrus, non-family organized alphabetically by name, and non-family
						organized by category.</p>
					<p>There are a number of Julian Burroughs letters in the family section, but
						there are also letters from Ursula Burroughs, his father Chauncey Burroughs,
						his brother Hiram, his sister Eden and others.</p>
					<p>The Clara Barrus section includes hundred of letters and postcards dating
						from 1904-1920 as well as a number of typescripts of letters from
						1901-1903.</p>
					<p>Correspondents in the alphabetical non-family section include a large number
						of friends, neighbors, and professional contacts. Of particular note are the
						letters from Poultney Bigelow, Clifton Johnson, Ludella Peck, Theodore
						Roosevelt, and the letter from Walt Whitman.</p>
					<p>The non-family section is organized by category and seems to have been
						arranged by Elizabeth Burroughs Kelley. It is possible, however, that they
						were arranged earlier by Clara Barrus and/or Burroughs himself The
						categories are sometimes broad, sometimes specific, and frequently
						overlap.</p>
