			<head>Biographical Note</head>
			<p>Ruth (Goodkind) Calvin (1902-1957) was born in Chicago to Doctor Maurice L. Goodkind (1866–1939) and Rose (Snydacker) Goodkind (1874–1940). She graduated from Vassar College with the class of 1922. During her college years and after, Calvin travelled extensively across the continental United States. In 1928, she married rancher James F. Calvin and settled in Cerrillos, New Mexico, where she lived until her death in 1957.</p>

The remainder of the album includes photographs of Glacier Park, Montana; Blackfoot Native Americans; cowboys, horses, and ranch life; Camp Hanoum in Vermont; Mt. Rainier, Washington; Rocky Mountain National Park and Great Sand Dunes National Park, Colorado; Logan Falls, Pennsylvania; San Ysidro Ranch in Santa Barbara; Chicago; and Kentucky.
