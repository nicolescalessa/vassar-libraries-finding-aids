Carroll was a professor of Art History at Vassar College from 1965 to 1999, serving as chair of the department from 1980 to 1983. He received a PhD from Harvard University in Art History (1964), and an M.A. in the History of Art from Harvard University (1958). He completed a Fulbright Scholarship in Florence, Italy in 1955, a fellowship at the American Academy in Rome (1958), and was later awarded membership at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton (1983).

			<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
			<p>The Papers of Eugene Carroll document Carroll's career as a Vassar professor, chair of the college's art history department, and his scholarly and curatorial pursuits focused on the study of the Italian mannerist painter, Rosso Fiorentino. Teaching files include handwritten notes and syllabi, some of which document Vassar academic culture at the time of Carroll's tenure. Correspondence files document his personal, academic, and professional life, including correspondence with colleagues from a range of academic and cultural institutions. Correspondence includes documentation regarding curatorial and general exhibition activities, advice to colleagues in the field of art history, and research efforts, including European travel related to Carroll's research on Fiorentino. Correspondence files after 2000 include copies of emails, both to and from Carroll. The papers also contain reference and research files, travel documentation including scrapbooks, photographic prints, date books
				and journals.</p>
			<p>The collection includes selected holdings from the Papers of W.K. Rose, once held by Eugene Carroll, executor of the Rose estate. Subseries in both the Carroll and Rose papers contain correspondence, biographical files, subject files, writings, printed materials, photographic prints, journals, datebooks, scrapbooks, and realia.</p>
			<p>See the associated guide to the Papers of W.K. Rose for additional holdings related to materials held in Series 1, Papers of William K. Rose.</p>
