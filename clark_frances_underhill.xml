Some of the prisoners were Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) members arrested after labor disturbances in Centralia, Washington. Included are six letters from Ray Becker, 1922-1927, and 41 letters from Warren K. Billings, 1924-1937.

			<head>Biographical Note</head>
			<p>Frances Underhill Clark (1868-1950) was born into a Quaker family. She attended Vassar Preparatory School and was graduated from Vassar College in 1891. Her sister, Adelaide Underhill (Vassar '88), was for many years a librarian at the college. A year after graduation, "Fanny," as she was called, married Dr. George Edward Clark. Although the Clarks never had any children of their own, they informally adopted two orphaned boys and educated a niece. In communications with the Vassar alumnae office Clark described herself as a "homekeeper" and also listed volunteer activities during World War I. As a Quaker she was concerned with the protection of human rights and maintained a large correspondence with political prisoners -- socialists, labor organizers, and conscientious objectors -- many of whom had been sentenced under legislation such as the Espionage Act and the California Criminal Syndicalism Act. She died December 16, 1950.</p>
