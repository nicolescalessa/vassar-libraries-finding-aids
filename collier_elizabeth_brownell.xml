			<head>Biographical Note </head>
			<p>Elizabeth Brownell Collier was born on December 30, 1883. Her mother, Laura Brownell Collier, was a member of a prominent New England family and her father, John Austin Collier, was a scientist. When she was a young girl, the family moved to Brooklyn, where Laura Collier taught at Packer Collegiate Institute, a private, all-girls academy. Both Elizabeth and her younger sister Katharine attended Packer. Elizabeth graduated from Packer in 1902 and spent a year at the University of Vermont before transferring to Vassar College. </p>
			<p>Elizabeth did well at Vassar, where she was named to Phi Beta Kappa and awarded the Furness Prize for best essay on a Shakespearean or Elizabethan subject. In 1909 she found a job teaching English at Hunter College in Manhattan. Elizabeth earned her Master of Arts from Columbia University at 1911 and spent a year studying in Oxford, England. </p>
			<p>When she was not at work, Elizabeth spent much of her time doing civic work. She was involved in the suffrage movement, and after women gained the vote, she was appointed Vice President of the New York City League of Women Voters, and Vice Chairman of the Brooklyn Republican Party. Among others, she worked closely with Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia. </p>
			<p>After her retirement, Elizabeth moved to Highland, New York, where she lived with an invalid friend, a Miss Grace Roberts. She returned often to visit the Vassar College campus. Elizabeth died on November 30, 1968, in a fire which destroyed her home. </p>

			<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
			<p>Material related to Collier's turn-of-the-century childhood, as well as her time at Vassar and beyond. Compared to the rest of the Collier Family Papers, this collection is very small. Most or all of the material was probably saved by Elizabeth's sister Katharine or her mother Laura, since whatever she owned at the time was probably destroyed in the fire in which she died. Elizabeth appears to have been an active and colorful figure who grew eccentric in her old age. </p>
