			<head>Biographical Note </head>
			<p>Born in 1853 outside Boston, MA, Florence Cushing was the daughter of an esteemed family known as "The family of judges" for their participation in legal affairs. Florence Cushing was the valedictorian of her Vassar class of 1874 and a member of Phi Beta Kappa. She was among the founders of the Girls' Latin School of Boston as well as the Associaltion of Collegiate Alumnae, which became the American Association of University Women, an organization of which she was the second president (1883-1885). She was the first alumna to sit on the Board of Trustees, and served between 1887-1894 and 1906-1912. In 1913, she was elected to life membership on the Board, a position which she held until 1923, when she became 'trustee emerita.' For her exemplary work and devotion to Vassar, Cushing Hall, built in 1923, was named after her. She died at home in Norwell, MA on 20 September 1927. For more information, see the <archref
