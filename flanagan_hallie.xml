			<head>Biographical Note</head>
			<p>Hallie Flanagan Davis, whose professional name was Hallie Flanagan, taught drama at Vassar, 1925-1942, and founded its experimental theater. She is more widely known, however, for her work in the 1930s as the director of the Federal Theater Project. She wrote several plays, numerous articles, and three books -- <emph render="italic">Arena</emph>, the story of the Federal Theatre; <emph render="italic">Dynamo</emph>, the story of the Vassar Theatre; and <emph render="italic">Shifting Scenes of the Modern European Theatre</emph>, the product of a year spent in Europe on a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1926.</p>
			<p>Hallie Flanagan was born Hallie Mae Ferguson in Redfield, South Dakota. She graduated from Grinnell College in 1911. In her own words, "The main thing that happened to me at college was Murray Flanagan." Hallie Ferguson married Murray Flanagan in 1912, but her "rapturous" marriage ended with her husband's death from tuberculosis in 1919. After teaching high school, Hallie Flanagan taught English courses at Grinnell College and wrote plays. While teaching at Grinnell, she also assisted with performances of plays. Her own play, <emph render="italic">The Curtain</emph>, won a prize and helped her gain admittance to Harvard professor George Pierce Baker's 47 Workshop for Playwrights. In 1924 she earned an A.M. degree from Radcliffe. Upon returning to Grinnell, she produced some of her plays, which attracted the attention of Vassar's president, Henry Noble MacCracken, who offered her a teaching position at Vassar.</p>
			<p>Hallie Flanagan's entire adult life was devoted to the theater as an educator, playwright, administrator, and director. From 1925 until 1942, she was a professor at Vassar. She founded and directed the Vassar Experimental Theatre, which was well known for the quality and originality of its productions. In 1934, during a sabbatical from Vassar, Hallie Flanagan directed the theater at Dartington Hall in England. She married Philip H. Davis, a professor of Greek at Vassar, in April of that year, keeping the name Flanagan professionally. In 1935 she took leave from Vassar to serve as director of the Federal Theatre Project, a unique effort in the history of American theater which staged over one thousand productions in forty cities. In 1942, Hallie Flanagan Davis went to Smith College as dean and professor of drama. She retired in 1955, at which time she moved back to Poughkeepsie. Hallie Flanagan Davis died in 1969, after a long struggle with Parkinson's disease.</p>

			<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
			<p>The collection primarily concerns her teaching and theater activities at Vassar College and her work with the Federal Theater Project and includes correspondence, curriculum materials, scripts and other play records, reports, speeches, programs, playbills, photographs, scrapbooks, and clippings. Correspondence consists of letters received and carbons of her outgoing letters to students and colleagues concerning her articles and books on the theater, the Russian theater, her experiences during a European trip, her Vassar classes, recommendations for her students, <emph render="italic">Theatre Arts Monthly</emph>, workers' theater such as the Arteff Theatre in New York, and other issues relating to the theater, 1925-1938. Correspondents include President Henry MacCracken of Vassar and her literary agent August Lenninger. There are also several letters from May Sarton concerning an amateur theatrical group she was working with and arrangements for a production at Vassar, 1933-1934; and two letters exchanged between Flanagan and T.S. Eliot about Flanagan's work and Eliot's suggestions for the setting, directions, and final scene for a production of his play <emph render="italic">Sweeney</emph>, 1933. Material on the Federal Theater Project consists of briefs, reports, scripts, playbills, and other printed matter.</p>

			<head>Acquisition Information</head>
			<p>This collection includes two major accessions. Approximately 4 cubic feet were purchased from Joanne Davis Bentley in 1988. The other was a transfer from the Vassar Drama Department at an unknown date before 1988.</p>
			<p>Six additional items were donated by Joanne Bentley in 2009: 2 letters from HFD (26 May 1930 and 16 June 1930), one diary fragment (beginning 19 Feb 1928), and a manuscript which is either a transcript of an interview with Shirley Rich Krohn or (more likely) a biographical piece written by HFD for "Dr. Wheelis" which was annotated by Shirley Rich Krohn. The other item is a folder of materials on Flanagan Bentley received by Bentley from the Federal Bureau of Investigation after filing a FOIA request. The items are now in folders 1.6, 20.161, 57.474a and 59.505.</p>
			<p>Series X. 2025 Addition (Box 92), was the gift of Kathy Mendoza (VC 1965), collected by her mother, Barbara Mendoza. [M2025-008]</p>

					<p>This series contains materials created by Hallie Flanagan, or about Hallie Flanagan and her work, that were collected by Barbara J. Mendoza during her research for her New York University doctoral dissertation, "Hallie Flanagan: Her Role in American Theatre, 1924-1935," 1976. Mendoza was given records related to Flanagan, the Vassar College English Department, and the Vassar Experimental Theatre, by the Vassar College English Department sometime around 1973. The series contains a mix of original and duplicate records created by Flanagan, the Vassar College English Department, and Mendoza.
