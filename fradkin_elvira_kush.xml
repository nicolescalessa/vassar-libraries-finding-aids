			<head>Biographical Note</head>
			<p>Elvira Kush Fradkin (1891-1972), a resident of Montclair, N.J. for many years,
				attended the Ethical Culture School in New York City and graduated from Vassar
				College in 1913. A year later, she received her Master's degree from Columbia, where
				she studied economics and psychology. She was married to Dr. Leon H. Fradkin, a
				dentist. Throughout the 1920's and 1930's, Mrs. Fradkin was active in organizations
				for peace, disarmament, and women's rights. She was the author of <emph render="italic">Chemical
					Warfare: Its Possibilities and Probabilities</emph>, published in 1929 by the Carnegie
				Endowment for International Peace, as well as <emph render="italic">The Air Menace and the Answer</emph> (1934).</p>
				<p>Following World War II, Mrs. Fradkin committed herself to supporting the United
				Nations. From 1947 to 1970, she represented the International Association for Liberal
				Christianity and Religious Freedom at the United Nations and she was a leader of
				the New Jersey branch of the American Association for the United Nations. In 1950,
				she published <emph render="italic">A World Airlift</emph>, in which she advocated for an international air police
				patrol under the United Nations. Mrs. Fradkin's support for a controversial causes
				was unswerving, even after she was the target of a Ku Klux Klan cross burning in
				1937. She died in 1972.</p>
