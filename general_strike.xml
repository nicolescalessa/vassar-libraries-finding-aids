			<head>Historical Note</head>
			<p>The General Strike was a massive wave of labor strikes that occurred in Great Britain in May of 1926. The strike originated in a dispute between coal miners, who wanted to protect their existing work conditions, and mine owners, who sought to cut wages and extend work hours. To force their demands, owners on May 1 locked roughly one million miners out of their mines. In response, the Trade Unions Congress (TUC), an umbrella organization of British trade unions, called for sympathy strikes throughout the country. By May 4 over one million workers in a variety of industries had answered the call and taken to the streets. The nation-wide strike lasted until May 12, when the TUC, under pressure from the government, called on strikers to return to their jobs. The coal miners' strike continued, however, until November, when the miners' own economic needs compelled them to accept mine owners' demands.</p>
