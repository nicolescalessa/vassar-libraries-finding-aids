			<head>Biographical Note </head>
			<p>Gloria Guardia was born in Venezuela. Her father, Carlos Guardia, was a sanitary engineer well known in Latin America; her mother, Olga Zeledon, was from a prominent Nicaraguan family. While she was a student at Vassar, Gloria spent her junior year in Spain and wrote her first novel, <emph render="underline">Tiniebla Blanca</emph>, based on her experiences at Vassar. She graduated in 1963 and continued her education at Columbia University, where she earned an M.A. She also studied Philosophy at the Universidad Complutense and Spanish and Latin American Literature in the Instituto de Cultura Hispánica, Madrid. In 1966 she was the first woman to win both of Panama's national literary awards, the Ricardo Miro Prizes, for a novel, <emph render="underline">Despertor Sin Raices</emph>, and a critical essay. Another novel, <emph render="underline">El Ultimo Juego</emph>, was awarded the "Premio Centroamericano de Novela" by EDUCA (Editorial Universitaria Centroamericana) in 1976. Other
				publications include <emph render="underline">Cartas apócrifas</emph> (Tercer Mundo, Bogota, 1996), <emph render="underline">Libertad en llamas</emph> (Plaza &amp; Janés, 1999), and <emph render="underline">Lobos al anochecer</emph> (Alfaguara, 2006). In 1984, Guardia was elected Fellow of the Panamanian Academy of Letters, and Associate Fellow of the Spanish Royal Academy of Letters in 1989, the Colombian Academy of Letters in 1997, and the Nicaraguan Academy of Letters in 2007. In 2006, during the 72° World Congress of International PEN held in Berlin, she was elected International Vice President of this prestigious world organization of writers, along with the Nobel Prize winners Toni Morrison and John Coetzee. As well as being a novelist, Guardia has worked as a literary critic and a journalist. She currently resides in Colombia (Bogota) and Panamá with her husband, Ricardo Alfaro.</p>
