			<head>Biographical Note </head>
			<p>Helen Harrison Morris Hadley (VC 1883) was the daughter of Luzon B. Morris, governor of Connecticut from 1894-1896. She was born in 1863 and later attended Vassar College, graduating with the class of 1883. In 1904 she was elected an Alumnae Trustee and was a member of the board for three terms totaling seventeen years. Mrs. Hadley served on several committees, notably the Committee on Euthenics and the Executive Committee. She was married to Arthur Twining Hadley, a political economist who was president of Yale from 1899-1921. Their son, Morris, and his wife, Katharine Blodgett Hadley, also served as trustees of Vassar. Mrs. Hadley's sister, Mary Morris Pratt, was also deeply involved with the college; and her son, Richardson Pratt, was a trustee. Mrs. Hadley's interest was not confined to her alma mater; her service to Yale was recognized in 1935, when she was awarded the honorary degree of Master of Arts, and in 1959, a graduate women's dormitory was named for her. She died on
				31 Mar 1939.</p>
