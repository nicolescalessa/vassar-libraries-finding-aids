			<head>Biographical Note </head>
			<p>Mary Ida Parmele was born Sept. 30, 1871, in West Bloomfield, N.Y., and grew up in Canandaigua, where she lived for the rest of her life. She spent two and a half years at Vassar from 1892-1895. In 1902 she married George Wright Hamlin, a banker, and might never have been known outside her community had it not been for her writing. She was especially interested in writing plays and ventured to send a script of a historical drama on the life of Alexander Hamilton to George Arliss. He agreed to collaborate with her on rewriting it and acted the lead in the Broadway production of Hamilton in 1917, and in 1918, when the play was on tour. In his autobiography Arliss wrote: "Mrs. Hamlin is probably the only woman alive who is a good wife, a good mother, a good housekeeper, a good friend, and a good playwright all in one." Her family concerns made it difficult for her to stay in touch with the theatrical world, and she turned to writing plays for amateurs - especially religious drama.
				Mrs. Hamlin was a Congregationalist and for twenty-five years taught a Bible class which had been started by her mother-in-law. Hamlin died in 1964.</p>
