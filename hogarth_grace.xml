			<head>Biographical Note </head>
			<p>Grace Weston Allen, born in Newton, Massachusetts in 1905, was educated at the University of California at Berkeley and at Vassar, where she graduated in 1927. Following two years of study at the Massachusetts School of Art and Yale University School of Fine Arts, she went to work for Oxford University Press as a staff artist and, later, as an editor of children's books. In 1936 she moved from Oxford's New York office to its London headquarters. That same year she married William David Hogarth, a publisher. In 1938 she left Oxford for Chatto &amp; Windus, a publisher with a shorter list of children's books that allowed her to spend more time with her family. During the early years of World War II Mrs. Hogarth and her children lived in Boston, where she was editor of children's books for Houghton Mifflin. In 1944 she returned to England; since that time she has worked for several publishing firms, chiefly as an editor and publisher of books for children. In the course of her
				career she worked with authors of many books that have become classics. Grace Allen Hogarth is also the author of many books for children and adults. A brief autobiographical account, "Confessions of a Liberated Woman," was published in the Fall 1972 Vassar Quarterly. </p>
