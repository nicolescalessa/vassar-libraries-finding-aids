			<head>Biographical Note </head>
			<p>Jeanne Russell Janish (1902-1998), a botanical illustrator, inherited her interest in science and her artistic ability from her parents. Her father was a paleontologist, and her mother studied and drew animals and flowers. During summer visits with her grandparents in Colorado she met botanists at a summer school run by the University of Minnesota. However, Jeanne Russell did not decide to become a scientific illustrator until she was a graduate student in geology at Stanford University, where she studied after graduating from Vassar College in 1924. At Stanford she built a reputation as an illustrator specializing in botanical subjects, and taught scientific illustration from 1936 to 1942. Janish produced over eleven thousand drawings for publication. She was married to Carl F. Janish, a businessman, who shared her enthusiasm for travel.</p>
