			<head>Biographical Note</head>
			<p>Jeh Vincent Johnson was an American architect and professor. Born in Nashville, Tennessee in 1931 to Marie Antoinette (Burgette) Johnson (1891-1965) and Charles Spurgeon Johnson (1893-1956), Johnson grew up on the campus of Fisk University, where his father taught Sociology, and later became its first African-American president. Johnson attended Columbia College and graduated with his B.A. in 1953 before being drafted into the U.S. Army for almost two years. After returning from service, he married Norma Edelin, the sister of his college roommate, Milton Edelin and returned to Columbia University to pursue his Master's in Architecture, which he received in 1958. After a short period working with acclaimed architect Paul R. Williams, and several years working for as a designer for Adams and Woodbridge Architects in New York City, Johnson relocated to the Hudson Valley in 1963 and joined the practice of practice of William Gindele (1925-2020) as an associate.</p>
			<p>In 1964, Johnson began teaching at Vassar College as a lecturer, and in 1968, became a full partner with Gindele, creating Gindele &amp; Johnson, PC Architects. In 1971, Johnson and several colleagues at the American Institute of Architects national convention in Detroit formed the National Organization of Minority Architects (NOMA). Johnson designed numerous buildings in Dutchess County, New York, particularly in Poughkeepsie. Buildings designed by Johnson include: the Vassar College Intercultural Center (now the Jeh V. Johnson ALANA Cultural Center), the Catharine Street Community Center, Central Baptist Church of Poughkeepsie, Tubman Terrace Apartments, Ebenezer Baptist Church, Poughkeepsie YMCA, and Saint Simeon Senior Citizens Apartments. Johnson also designed many renovations, rehabilitations, and additions to existing buildings, including hundreds of private residences. He taught at Vassar until his retirement in 2001. Johnson and his wife Norma had two children: Jeh Charles Johnson (1957-) and Marguerite Marie Johnson (1959-2020).</p>
			<p>He died in 2021 at the age of 89.</p>
