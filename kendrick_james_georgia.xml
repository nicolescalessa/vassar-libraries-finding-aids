			<head>Biographical Note </head>
			<p>J. Ryland Kendrick, (1821-1889) a Baptist minister, was born in Poultney, VT and was graduated from Brown University. He served as a pastor in the South and in New York City before coming to Poughkeepsie in 1872 as minister to the First Baptist Church. Kendrick became a trustee of Vassar College in 1875, and in 1885 served as acting president during a difficult year in the college's history following the resignation of President Caldwell and preceding the appointment of James Monroe Taylor.</p>
			<p>Kendrick's wife, Georgia Avery Kendrick (1848-1922), began her close connection to Vassar after her husband's death. In 1891 she was appointed Lady Principal, a position she held for twenty-two years. As social head of the college Mrs. Kendrick worked very closely with President Taylor during years of growth in the college and influenced the lives of thousands of college women. She retired in 1913 because of declining health. Upon her death she was eulogized for her warmth, dignity, and commitment to academic standards.</p>
