			<head>Biographical Note</head>
			<p>Christine Ladd-Franklin, psychologist, mathematician, and logician, was born in
				Windsor, CT. She took the college preparatory course at Wesleyan Academy in
				Wilbraham, MA, and continued her education at Vassar, graduating in 1869. After
				leaving Vassar, Ladd taught science in various secondary schools, studied
				mathematics on her own, and published several articles on mathematics in the <emph
					render="italic">English Educational Times</emph>. At the age of thirty-two she
				was admitted to graduate study at Johns Hopkins, where she met her husband, Fabian
				Franklin, a professor of mathematics. While at Johns Hopkins, she contributed
				several papers to the <emph render="italic">American Journal of Mathematics</emph>.
				Ladd-Franklin pursued her scholarly career with remarkable energy, beginning with
				work in symbolic logic and continuing with her research in the theory of vision,
				especially color vision, which formed a significant contribution to psychology. Her
				paper on binocular vision was published in the first volume of the <emph
					render="italic">American Journal of Psychology</emph> (November 1887). A Ph.D.
				was given, belatedly, by John Hopkins in 1926. Vassar awarded her an honorary LL.D.
				in 1887, the only honorary degree ever awarded by Vassar. A lecturer in psychology
				and logic at Johns Hopkins and Columbia, Ladd-Franklin was associate editor for J.
				M. Baldwin's three-volume Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology (1901-05),
				presented papers at several international congresses, as well as meetings of the
				American Philosophical Association and American Psychological Association.</p>
			<p>Throughout her life, Ladd-Franklin worked to widen women's opportunities for
				education and academic employment. With her daughter, Margaret, she shared an
				interest in the campaign for women's suffrage.</p>
		</bioghist>
		<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
			<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
			<p>The collection contains two original manuscript diaries, dated approximately
				1860-1866 and 1866-1873, which describe Ladd-Franklin's experiences as a Vassar
				student, the challenges of financing her education, and her early years of teaching
				before beginning her graduate work in mathematics. They also express a determined
				feminism and irritation with contemporary attitudes toward women and limitations on
				their freedom and opportunities. Also included is one letter to Ladd-Franklin's
				younger brother Henry from 1869.</p>
