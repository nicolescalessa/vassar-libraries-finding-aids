			<head>Biographical Note</head>
			<p>Helen Lockwood was born May 8, 1891, in Clifton Springs, NY. Following the example of
				her mother, Mary E. Lamson (VC 1890), she was graduated from Vassar in 1912. The
				following fifteen years were spent in study, travel, and teaching. After earning a
				doctorate in comparative literature from Columbia, she taught at Wellesley,
				1925-1927, and at the Bryn Mawr School for Women Workers in Industry, 1921-1923. She
				returned to Vassar in 1927, was made a full professor in 1936, and served as
				chairman of the English department from 1950 until her retirement in 1956.</p>
			<p>Helen Lockwood was an outstanding teacher and a challenging member of the faculty.
				Her courses, whether on romantic poets or the contemporary press, were considered a
				memorable part of a student's program. A supporter of interdisciplinary studies,
				Helen Lockwood played a leading role in the American Culture and Today's Cities
				programs; she also supported the euthenics program. Education, in her view, should
				prepare the individual to act effectively in society, and she herself deeply
				interested in the social and cultural life of the local community. Helen Lockwood
				died in England in 1971, where she spent most summers and much of her retirement.
				Her unrestricted gift to the college of more than six million dollars was one of the
				largest in Vassar's history.</p>
