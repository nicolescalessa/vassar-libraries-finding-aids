			<head>Biographical Note</head>
			<p>Amy Lowell (1874-1925), American poet, biographer, critic, and celebrity, was born in Brookline, Massachusetts. Born to the wealth, culture, and intellectual distinction of the famous Lowell family, as a young woman she lived the life of a Boston socialite. She was a debutante, she travelled abroad, and she gave her share of service to civic and cultural affairs. Shortly after the turn of the century, Amy Lowell, determined to become a poet and writer, dropped many of her social obligations. Her first book of poems, <emph render="italic">A Dome of Many-Coloured Glass</emph>, was published in 1912. From then until her death, Amy Lowell regularly wrote and published both poetry and critical works. Strongly influenced by Harriet Monroe's magazine <emph render="italic">Poetry</emph>, she recognized her own poetic identity with "Imagism" and the new poetry, and became a dominating figure in the movement. Her eccentricity was notorious; and her charm, intelligence, and vibrancy won her many friends and admirers. In her later years Amy Lowell suffered frequently from ill health; at the age of fifty-one she died of a cerebral hemorrhage, not long after she had completed her biography of John Keats. This was her most important critical work and ranks among the greatest biographies in English literature.</p>
