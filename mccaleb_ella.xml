			<head>Biographical Note </head>
			<p>Ella McCaleb (1856 -1933), first dean of Vassar College, was born in Mt. Pleasant, Pennsylvania, and was graduated from Vassar in 1878. After teaching for seven years she returned to Vassar in 1885 as secretary to the president. Seven years later, in 1893, her title became Secretary of the College; and in the succeeding years she attained the ranks of associate professor and professor. Miss McCaleb's duties included much of the college's academic affairs, and it is reported that for many years she and President Taylor personally conducted the entire correspondence of the college.</p>
			<p>By 1913 the expansion of the college required adjustments in its administration. Miss McCaleb, known as "Kay," was appointed by President Taylor to the newly created position of Dean of the College and moved into a new house given to the college by the alumnae for her lifetime use. In the years of President MacCracken's administration until her retirement in 1923, Dean McCaleb provided a strong link to the college's earlier years.</p>
