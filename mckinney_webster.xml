They were donated to Vassar College in 1977, along with the endowment of a chair in American Literature, in honor of Jean Webster. The donors are Jean McKinney Connor, daughter of Jean Webster and Glenn Ford McKinney, and her husband Ralph Connor, a former trustee of Vassar.</abstract>

			<head>Biographical Note </head>
			<p>Jean Webster, christened Alice Jane Chandler Webster, was born in Fredonia, NY on July 24, 1876. Her mother, Annie Moffett Webster, was a niece of Mark Twain. Her father, Charles Luther Webster, was Twain's partner and publisher in the ill-fated Charles L. Webster Publishing Company. </p>
			<p>Webster's education included several years at the Fredonia Normal School, graduating in 1894 in china painting, and in 1897 from the college division. From 1894-1896, she attended the Lady Jane Grey boarding school in Binghamton, NY. It was at Lady Jane Grey that she changed her name from Alice to Jean when she discovered that her roommate was also named Alice. In 1897 she entered Vassar College as a member of the class of 1901. As an undergraduate Jean Webster wrote a weekly column of "chatty news" for the <emph render="italic"> Poughkeepsie Sunday Courier </emph> and a number of stories for the <emph render="italic"> Vassar Miscellany. </emph> It was also at Vassar that she met Adelaide Crapsey, the poet, who remained her close friend until Crapsey's death in 1914. </p>
			<p>After graduating from Vassar, Webster earned her living as a free-lance writer and novelist, living in New York City. Her first novel, <emph render="underline"> When Patty Went to College</emph>, was published in 1903. It chronicled the trials, tribulations, and adventures of life at a women's college. Altogether Webster wrote eight novels and countless unpublished stories and plays, in a style often described as realistic, refreshing, and witty. <emph render="underline"> Daddy Long-Legs</emph>, the story of an orphan whose anonymous benefactor sends her to college, was a best seller and later adapted to the stage by Henry Miller, starring Ruth Chatterton. The play enjoyed a long and successful run in New York, and also toured the Midwest, California, and London. Later film versions starred Mary Pickford and Janet Gaynor, among others. </p>
			<p>Jean Webster possessed a love of travel her entire life, beginning with a semester abroad in France, Italy, and England while at Vassar. In 1906/07 she embarked on a world tour with Ethelyn McKinney, her future sister-in-law, and Lena Weinstein, a close friend. Together the women journeyed to Egypt, India, Southeast Asia, China, and Japan. </p>
			<p>Webster also had a deep interest in many social reform movements. She was concerned for the plight of orphans and in orphan asylum reform as well as prison reform. In addition, she was a staunch suffragist. One interesting episode in Webster's life was the incident when she was called to jury duty because the authorities had assumed she was a man. Since she was a woman, however, she was not allowed to serve on a jury, much to her chagrin.</p>
			<p>For seven years Jean Webster was secretly engaged to Glenn Ford McKinney, a wealthy lawyer and son of the oil magnate John Luke McKinney. Glenn, married to another woman who was plagued by bouts of insanity and weighed down by personal problems himself, couldn't help but submit to Jean's sunny disposition and charm. He finally obtained a divorce in June of 1915, and he and Jean were married among a flurry of activity on September 7, about the same time that "Daddy Long-Legs" was touring and its sequel, <emph render="underline"> Dear Enemy</emph>, was published. The McKinneys made their home at Tymor Farm, in Union Vale, Dutchess County, NY, a sanctuary of fields, deer, wild ducks, and pheasants. On the evening of June 10, 1916, the inseparable Ethelyn McKinney and Lena Weinstein accompanied Jean to Sloane Hospital in New York City for the delivery of her baby girl, Jean Webster McKinney. The next morning, June 11, Jean Webster died of complications from childbirth.</p>

			<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
			<p>The Jean Webster Papers encompass most of Jean Webster's adult life. They include some correspondence to friends and family, college notebooks, travel journals, as well as later notebooks filled with story ideas, suggestions, and drafts. The collection also includes original manuscripts of unpublished short stories and plays, although none of the final drafts of her novels or the stage adaptation of <emph render="underline"> Daddy Long-Legs </emph> remain. Memorabilia and realia include playbills, reviews, photographs, and newspaper clippings chronicling the success of <emph render="underline"> Daddy Long-Legs</emph> and other novels and plays; her travels; and family and friends. The researcher should also be aware that only a few of the letters from Jean Webster to Glenn Ford McKinney, and none of the letters from Glenn to Jean survived the years. The letters Jean Webster wrote to Glenn Ford McKinney are located in the Glenn Ford McKinney papers at the Vassar College Libraries
				Department of Special Collections.</p>
			<p>Two addendums to the Jean Webster Papers are a section of material on Jean Webster' s boarding school, the Lady Jane Grey School, and the Adelaide Crapsey material. The Lady Jane Grey material consists mainly of copies of the <emph render="italic"> Mosaic</emph>, the school's magazine or newsletter, as well as some miscellaneous information on the history of the school and Binghamton itself. The second supplement, the Adelaide Crapsey material, consists mainly of final drafts of most of Crapsey's poems. Also included is some biographical information and correspondence from Crapsey to Webster, and Crapsey's mother, Adelaide Trowbridge Crapsey, to Jean McKinney and Ethelyn McKinney. The researcher should note that although the originals of Crapsey's poems are restricted due to their fragility, all of them have been photocopied to ensure access.</p>
