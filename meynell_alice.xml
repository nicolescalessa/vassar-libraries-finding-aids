			<head>Biographical Note </head>
			<p>Alice Thompson Meynell (1847-1922), noted English poet, essayist, and journalist, was born near London but spent most of her youth in Italy and France, where she and her sister were educated by their father. She became a Roman Catholic at the age of 20 and remained profoundly religious throughout her life. An admirer of 17th-century poetry, she published volumes of verse and essays, and she edited various anthologies. Her first book of poems, <emph render="underline"> Preludes</emph>, was published in 1875 and began the remarkable career that won Alice Meynell the admiring attention of the great writers of her time.</p>
			<p>In 1877 she married the journalist Wilfred Meynell, and their modest London home became a popular gathering spot for the journalists, suffragists, Christian socialists and literati they befriended. The couple had eight children, several of whom became significant figures in the literary world as well. </p>
