			<head>Biographical Note</head>
			<p>Marianne Moore (1887-1972) was born in Kirkwood, MO, and grew up in a happy
				atmosphere of familial affection and intimacy. With the exception of her years at
				Bryn Mawr, Miss Moore lived almost constantly with her mother and was never far from
				her brother, John Warner Moore. After graduation from Bryn Mawr in 1909, Miss Moore
				studied at the Carlisle Commercial College and went on to work as an indexer for
				Melvil Dewey and to teach commercial subjects at an Indian school. Marianne Moore
				did not seriously begin to write poetry until after 1914. Her poems appeared in
					<emph render="italic">Poetry</emph>, <emph render="italic">Others</emph>, <emph
					render="italic">The Dial</emph>, and <emph render="italic">The Egoist</emph>. </p>
			<p>Soon Moore began to attract attention despite her habitual self-disparagement. In
				1924 her observations won The Dial Award; and from then until its demise in 1929,
				that magazine absorbed much of Moore's energy both as a writer and editor. Her <emph
					render="italic">Selected Poems</emph> was published in 1935, with an
				introduction by T.S. Eliot; and in the next two decades she continued to publish
				volumes of poetry - <emph render="italic">Pangolin and Other Verse</emph>, <emph
					render="italic">What Are Years</emph>, and <emph render="italic"
					>Nevertheless</emph> - establishing her as a first-rate poet. In the early 1950s
				Marianne Moore was showered with prizes, including the Bollingen, the Pulitzer, and
				the National Book Award. In 1955 she was elected to the American Academy of Arts and
				Letters. In her later years she was a popular celebrity, known for her tricorn hats
				and love of baseball.</p>
