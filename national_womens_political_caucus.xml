			<head>Administrative History</head>
			<p>The National Women's Political Caucus was organized in 1971 to get American women involved in politics and, more specifically, to get as many women as possible elected or selected as delegates to the major party national conventions of 1972. Eventually, branches were organized in forty-six states; and there are many local groups such as the one in Dutchess County.</p>
			<p>The Tri-State Caucus was never affiliated with the National Caucus, and a conflict developed between the two groups when it came time to organize a New York State Caucus. The Women’s Political Caucus of Dutchess County was organized by the Tri-State Caucus, but it was also affiliated with the National Women’s Political Caucus.</p>
			<p>The Women’s Center in Poughkeepsie was opened in 1972 to provide counseling services, child care, consciousness-raising sessions, etc. It closed at the end of 1973 as interest waned, at least locally, in the women’s liberation movement.</p>
