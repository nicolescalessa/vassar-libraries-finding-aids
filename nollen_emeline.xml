Her mother was Anna Jane Barston, and her father was Reverend Edward Otis Bartlett, a native of Poughkeepsie. She graduated from Vassar College in 1894 and went on to graduate school at the University of Chicago. She was a preceptress at Iowa College Academy in Grinnell, IA from 1895 to 1898, and later taught Greek (and possibly Latin) at the Halsted School in Yonkers, NY, Allegheny Academy in Pennsylvania, a school owned by her brother in Saratoga, NY, and the Ethical Culture School in New York City. </p>
