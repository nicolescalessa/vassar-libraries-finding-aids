			<head>Biographical Note </head>
			<p>Alice Huyler Ramsey (VC ex 1907) was the first woman to drive across the United States, a feat accomplished in 1909. </p>
			<p>Alice Ramsey was born in Hackensack, New Jersey on November 11, 1886, the daughter of John Edwin Huyler and Ada Farr Huyler. Her father was a coal dealer and captain of a steam launch who encouraged his daughter's interest in machines. Although she entered Vassar College in 1903, she left after only two years to marry John Rathbone Ramsey (1862-1933). Her attorney husband was the Clerk of Bergen County when they married and later served in the U.S. Congress (1917-1921). Their son, John Rathbone Ramsey, Jr. (1907-2000), graduated from Princeton University and attended Harvard Law School. After receiving his theological degree from the General Theological Seminary, he served as an Episcopal priest for more than 67 years. Their daughter, Alice Valleau Huyler Bruns (1910- ), was a member of the Vassar College class of 1931. </p>
			<p>Ramseyâ€™s husband bought her a car in the spring of 1908 after carriage horses bolted on her. The new automobile seemed safer. During her first summer behind the wheel, she drove 6,000 miles, mostly exploring roads in New Jersey. After an "endurance run" on Long Island to Montauk, she was approached by Carl Kelsey, then Sales Manager of the Maxwell-Briscoe [Automobile] Company to consider a cross country journey. The trip had recently been made by men, but no woman had made the trip. </p>
			<p>On June, 1909, she set out from New York City with her husbands sisters Margaret Atwood and Nettie Powell, and friend Hermine Jahns. Ramsey was the only one of the four who could drive. With advance man John D. Murphy traveling ahead to publicize the trip and arrange for Maxwell-Briscoe agents to have tires, parts and mechanics available, they drew curious crowds and dealt with harsh driving conditions where few roads were paved. Their 3,800, 50-day journey took them across New York to Chicago and then through Nebraska, Wyoming, Utah, and Nevada to San Francisco. The trip included 11 spare tires, a broken axle, rain, mud, desert, prairie dog holes and a road block of policemen searching for a murderer. Traveling across Wyoming, they followed wagon trails that disappeared so often, they had to follow local cars whose drivers could lead them to their destination. </p>
			<p>After her journey, she returned to New Jersey to her husband and young son. Subsequently, she made at least 30 more cross-country trips, including a 1919 journey with her son and daughter, friend, and another child. After her husband's death, she moved to Ridgewood, New Jersey, and in 1954 to Covina, California.</p>
			<p>The 50th anniversary of Ramsey's trip brought a revival of interest in her accomplishment. She was honored as "Woman Motorist of the Century" at the 1960 Automobile Show in Detroit. She published <emph render="italic">Veil, Duster and Tire Iron </emph> in 1961. It was annotated and republished in 2005. In 2000, she became the first woman to be inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame. </p>
