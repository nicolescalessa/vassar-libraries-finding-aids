			<head>Biographical Note </head>
			<p>Martha May Reynolds was born in Poughkeepsie, NY, and was graduated from Vassar in 1915. Two years later she received an M.A. in psychology from Columbia and returned to Vassar as an assistant in the psychology department. From 1918 to 1919 she worked in France for the Y.M.C.A. After two years as the psychologist with the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Children in Rochester, NY, Reynolds returned to graduate study in 1925 as a Laura Spelman Rockefeller Fellow at Columbia Teachers College, earning her Ph.D. in 1928. In 1931 Reynolds came to Vassar as a Professor of Child Study, Director of the Nursery School, and director of the children’s school at the Vassar Summer Institute of Euthenics. She was married in 1936 to Otoe K. Sherwin, and a year later left Vassar. In the following decades Reynolds (Sherwin) raised four children and wrote books and articles on the subject of child care and development. She was an advisory editor of Parents’ Magazine. The Sherwins lived on an
				estate in Wappingers Falls, which they donated in 1959 to the New York Conference of the United Church for use as a conference center and retreat. See also her publications in the Alumnae/Alumni Collection.</p>
			<p>Martha May Reynolds Sherwin died in 1978.</p>
