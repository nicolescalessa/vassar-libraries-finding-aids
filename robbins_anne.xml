			<head>Biographical Note </head>
			<p>Anne Robbins was an unmarried English woman of apparent means and cultivation who was probably born at the end of the eighteenth century. She was the great-great aunt of Jane J. Swenarton, professor of English at Vassar, 1926-1954, who transcribed and edited a diary kept by Anne Robbins during a European tour in the summer of 1827. She was one of a party of ten persons which was led by members of the Steward family of Ipswich. They were accompanied by three servants. In the diary Robbins mentions that she had lived in Brussels, and Professor Swenarton surmised that she may have been educated in that city.</p>
