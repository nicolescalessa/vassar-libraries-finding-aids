			<head>Biographical Note </head>
			<p>Margery Ryerson (1886-1989) graduated from Vassar College in 1909. She went on to study painting with Charles Hawthorne at the Cape School of Art in Provincetown, MA, and with Robert Henri at the Art Students League in New York City. In addition to working as an artist, Ryerson taught art in New York settlement houses. In 1923 she published <emph render="italic">The Art Spirit</emph> on the teachings of Robert Henri. As an artist, Ryerson excelled at portraiture, particulary of children, several of her images of which were used by the United Nations Children’s Fund to illustrate stamps and greeting cards.</p>
