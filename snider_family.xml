			<head>Biographical Note </head>
			<p>Twins Mary and Marguerite Snyder graduated from Vassar in 1918. Born December 20, 1895 in Uniontown, Pennsylvania to Frank and Hannah (Happie) L. Snider, they returned to Uniontown after their graduation. Both Mary and Marguerite worked with the Red Cross during World War and after, Marguerite until 1925 and Mary until at least 1947. Marguerite earned a certificate in economic research and community organization at Bryn Mawr in 1921 and her C.L.U. from the College of Life Underwriters. She worked as an underwriter for the Equitable Life Assurance Society beginning in 1925. She married attorney Buell B. Whitehill in 1945. She died in October 1980. Mary did not marry and lived at the family home on Kensington Avenue in Uniontown until at least 1960. Alumnae surveys in 1947 and 1956 indicate that she was the Home Service Secretary of the American Red Cross’s Fayette County chapter. In 1960, she reported that she was the part-time Executive Secretary of the Mental Health Association
				of Fayette County. She retired in 1971. Mary Snider died in 1997. </p>
