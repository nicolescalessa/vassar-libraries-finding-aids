			<head>Biographical Note </head>
			<p>Natalie Davis Spingarn, a free-lance writer specializing in health care, was born in New York City. She was graduated from Vassar in 1943, and a year later married Jerome Spingarn, a lawyer who has served as a governmental advisor on arms control. Since that time she has been a freelance journalist writing on health, social welfare, and urban problems. Her work has won national attention; in 1976 Spingarn was the recipient of the Robert T. Morse Award of the American Psychiatric Association for her “writings which have broadened public understanding of medical research and treatment.” She has served as an assistant to Senator Abraham Ribicoff and to the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare; she has also served as consultant for organizations such as the Ford Foundation and National Urban Coalition. In addition to writing for newspapers, magazines, and television, Natalie Davis Spingarn has written several books, including <emph render="underline"> To Save Your Life</emph>
				(1963) and <emph render="underline"> Heartbeat: The Politics of Health Research</emph> (1976). She was later appointed Executive Director of the National Commission of Confidentiality of Health Records.</p>
