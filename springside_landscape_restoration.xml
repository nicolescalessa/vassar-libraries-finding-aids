			<head>Historical Note</head>
			<p>The property called "Springside" was purchased by Matthew Vassar (1792-1868) in 1850,
				who hired notable American landscape architect Andrew Jackson Downing (1815-1852) to
				design the property as an ornamental farm over the next two years. The landscape and
				buildings were constructed based on Downing's designs over the next several years
				and it served as Matthew Vassar's summer home until his death in 1868. With no
				direct heirs and no instructions in his will as to what should become of the
				property, Springside changed hands several times before being purchased at auction
				in 1879 by William Nelson. The property remained with the Nelson family for almost a
				century, but by the 1960s it had fallen into disrepair and only one building, the
				Porter's Lodge, remained fully intact. The property was photographed by Rollie
				McKenna and in 1969 Springside was added to the United States National Register of 
				Historic Places. Despite this historical site status, in 1982 developer
				Springside Associates (later Springside Condominiums, Inc.) received approval from
				the City of Poughkeepsie to build a luxury condominium complex on the historic
				property. This galvanized local preservationists, including Vassar faculty member
				Harvey Flad and local nonprofit organizations Dutchess County Landmarks Association
				and Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Inc., to petition the City of Poughkeepsie to
				have an environmental assessment of the property conducted and to deny Springside
				Associates permission to build on the property.</p>
			<p>Springside Landscape Restoration (SLR) was formed in 1984 as part of a compromise
				between the preservationists, Springside Associates, and the City of Poughkeepsie.
				It was officially chartered as an educational non-profit by the New York State
				Department of Education in 1987. Part of the compromise included a subdivision of
				the property, with the parcel determined to be the most historic portion officially
				deeded to SLR in 1990. SLR has since maintained the property and undertaken a number
				of projects to conserve and restore Andrew Jackson Downing's original vision,
				including repainting and the Porter's Lodge, clearing almost 20 acres of secondary
				growth that was not part of Downing's vision, and protecting the site from
				potentially destructive development projects.</p>
