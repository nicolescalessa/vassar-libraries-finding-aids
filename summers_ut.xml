			<head>Biographical Note </head>
			<p>U.T. Summers (Vassar Class of 1941) was a writer and professor. U. T. Miller was her full maiden name: Her parents were students at the University of Texas when she was born and they wanted to honor the school they held so dear. She was born in Texas, then moved to Kentucky, but rounded out her childhood in McKenzie, Tennessee. Acceptance to, and funding for, her Vassar education was aided by Boyce Alexander Gooch, fellow Tennessean and Vassar Class of 1915. After leaving Vassar she did graduate work at Radcliffe, worked as an editor at Houghton Mifflin, and married Joseph H. Summers, then a Harvard Ph.D. student. In 1969 the couple moved to western New York. He took a professorship in the English Department of the University of Rochester and she joined the faculty in the College of Liberal Arts at RIT. The Summers had an impressive circle of literary friends, including Elizabeth Bishop, James Merrill, Mona Van Duyn, and others. Joseph Summers died in 2003.</p>
