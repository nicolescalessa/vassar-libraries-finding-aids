			<head>Biographical Note </head>
			<p>Polish composer Karol Szymanowski was born October 3, 1882 in the Ukraine and moved to Warsaw in 1901. With three other composers (Fitelberg, Rozycki, and Szeluta), he formed Young Poland in Music which was similar to the Young Poland movement in literature. Szymanowski's work was singled out for praise in a program of works by Young Poland composers in Warsaw and Berlin in 1906. His early work was strongly influenced by German composers such as Wagner and Richard Strauss, but beginning in 1914, his work began to be more influenced by modern French and Russian music and by his interest in Mediterranean and Arab cultures. This period during World War I proved to be his most prolific. </p>
			<p>Szymanowski's family, members of the landed gentry, had moved to the Ukraine after the partition of Poland. The family was greatly impacted by the Russian Revolution in 1917 and during this time, Szymanowski found it difficult to compose. Instead, he read widely and concentrated on writing a novel, only fragments of which survive. He also began working on the opera <emph render="italic">King Roger</emph>, set in the 12th century Byzantine court in Sicily. </p>
			<p>During the 1920's, Szymanowski's work reflected a growing sense of Polish nationalism. In 1921, his first new work in three years, was the song cycle <emph render="italic">Słopiewnie</emph>, which he orchestrated in 1923. Its words were written by Julian Tuwim in a Slavic-derived language which combined old root words and word-endings in new combinations. Experimental in nature, it could not be translated. <emph render="italic">Słopiewnie, op. 46b</emph> includes five songs: "Słowisień," "Zielone Słowa," "Świety Franciszek," "Kalinowe Dwory" and "Wanda." Szymanowski became director of the Warsaw Conservatory in 1927 and rector of the State Academy of Music in 1930. Neither were good experiences and he was dismissed from the Conservatory in 1929 and from the Academy in 1932. He died in March 29, 1937 in Lausanne, Switzerland. </p>
