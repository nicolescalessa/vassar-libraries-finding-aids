			<head>Biographical Note </head>
			<p>Eva March Tappan, the only child of a Baptist minister and a former school teacher, was born in Blackstone, MA. She was graduated in 1875 from Vassar, where she began to develop an interest in writing. After graduation she turned to teaching, going to Wheaton Seminary. Later she was able to begin graduate studies in English at the University of Pennsylvania, where she earned a Ph.D. in 1896. In the same year she published her first children’s book, <emph render="underline">Charles Lamb, the Man and the Author</emph>. The next year she took a position as head of the English department at English High School in Worcester, MA. By 1904 Miss Tappan had published nine more books, among them <emph render="underline"> In the Days of Alfred the Great</emph> and <emph render="underline">Old Ballads in Prose</emph>, giving her sufficient income to retire from teaching. Her books, many of which were textbooks, were mostly devoted to history, biography, the retelling of folk tales, and
				literary classics such as <emph render="underline">The Chaucer Story Book</emph>. Eva March Tappan also translated many foreign folk tales, and her work placed her in the forefront of the trend toward historical and folk stories for children. Until her death Tappan lived quietly in Worcester, attending meetings of the local Vassar Club and the Boston Authors’ Club, but devoting most of her energy to the careful and thorough research which distinguishes her work.</p>
