			<head>Administrative History</head>
			<p>The Vassar Club of Washington, D.C. was founded in 1887 as the Association of Vassar
				Alumnae of Washington and the South. Four years later, in February 1891, a separate
				organization, the Washington Branch of the Vassar Students Aid Society was formed
				specifically to raise scholarship funds for Washington-area women to attend Vassar
				College. Another reason for the separate organization was to provide a group that
				could include women who had attended Vassar College but had not graduated. Later,
				when the main club decided to include non-graduates, the Students Aid Society
				disbanded and reformed as a club committee.</p>
