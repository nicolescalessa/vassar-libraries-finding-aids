			<head>Administrative History</head>
			<p>Vassar has had a library since the college opened in 1865. The first library consisted of one room in Main Building with approximately three thousand books. As the collection grew, the need for more space became apparent. In 1893, Frederick Ferris Thompson, a Vassar trustee, donated the funds for an addition jutting out from the center of the building. After Thompson's death, his wife, Mary Clark Thompson, had a new building erected in his honor, which was completed in 1905. Additions to Thompson Memorial Library include the 1937 connection to Taylor Hall, which includes the Van Ingen Art Library; the 1976 Helen D. Lockwood Library; and the Martha Rivers and E. Bronson Ingram Library, completed in 2001, which includes the Catherine Pelton Durrell Archives and Special Collections Library. </p>
