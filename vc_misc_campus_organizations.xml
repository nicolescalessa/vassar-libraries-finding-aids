				<bioghist>
					<p> The Qui Vive Club was established by the Sophomore class in the Spring of
						1882 as a club for the discussion of current, historical, and literary
						topics. Minnie Cumnock Blodgett served as its first president. Qui Vive
						regularly invited lecturers to speak on various topics and hosted debates on
						a variety of issues. They often debated with Vassar's other debate club, the
						politically-oriented T &amp; M Club. These two clubs were abolished in the
						Spring of 1917 and replaced by the new Vassar Debating Society, later called
						the Vassar College Debate Society.</p>

					<p> Established in 1887, the Vassar College Microscopical Club's stated

						biology laboratory, to research and examine scientific specimens such as
						water samples from the Vassar lake, starfish, and Bryozoa. It was disbanded
						after only 2 years, in February of 1890. </p>
