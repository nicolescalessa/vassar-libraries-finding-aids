			<head>Administrative History</head>
			<p>Physical education at Vassar had its beginnings with the founding of the college. The physical health of the students was considered a critical part of the college's mission, specifically because of the prevalent 19th century fear that too much education would physcially harm young women. The health of the students was monitored carefully, and records were updated regularly by the college physician. </p>
