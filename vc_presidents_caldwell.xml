			<head>Biographical Note </head>
			<p>Samuel L. Caldwell was born in Newburyport, Massachusetts in 1820. After graduating from Waterville College (now Colby College) in 1839, Caldwell worked in academic administration before attending Newton Theological Seminary. After graduating from the seminary in 1845, Caldwell dedicated himself to ministry, preaching in Baptist churches in Virginia, Maine, and Rhode Island for fifteen years.</p>
			<p>Caldwell became president of Vassar College on September 12, 1878. Like his two predecessors, he was a Baptist minister, but he lacked the experience of administering an institution of higher education. Over the years, he drew criticism from alumnae for not adequately fostering relations between the college and preparatory schools in order to secure a larger and stronger student population. Eventually, the Trustees were in agreement with this dissatisfaction. Caldwell resigned from the presidency in 1885, and J. Ryland Kendrick, another Baptist minister on the Board of Trustees, served as acting president until James Monroe Taylor was appointed president in 1886. Caldwell died in 1889.</p>
