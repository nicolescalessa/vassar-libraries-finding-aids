			<head>Biographical Note </head>
			<p>Milo P. Jewett, first president of Vassar College, was born in St. Johnsbury, VT in 1801. He attended Dartmouth College and Andover Theological Seminary. In 1839 he founded the Judson Female Institute in Alabama, which was known as one of the best schools for women in the ante-bellum south. A few years later he was ordained in the Baptist ministry, having changed his views on baptism. In 1855 Jewett purchased the Cottage Hill Seminary in Poughkeepsie. There he met Matthew Vassar and is credited with suggesting to Vassar that he use his fortune to establish a women's college. Jewett was one of the original trustees of Vassar College and was elected president in 1861. Disagreements with other board memebers and ultimately with Matthew Vassar forced Jewett's resignation in 1864. In spite of his short tenure he did much to shape the early years of the college, arranging for the purchase of land and the construction of buildings which still serve the college. In 1867 Jewett moved to
				Milwaukee, where he lived out the rest of his life as an active participant in educational, philanthropic, and religious affairs. Jewett died in 1882.</p>
