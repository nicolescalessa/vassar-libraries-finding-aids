			<head>Administrative History</head>
			<p>Vassar's Social Museum opened in 1937 and was located on the top floor of Blodgett Hall. Its purpose was to provide research material and assistance in the social sciences for Vassar faculty and students as well as the local community. The museum had a special focus on Dutchess County and the Hudson Valley but engaged in projects related to national and global issues as well. In March 1943, in order to curb spending in the face of war-related economic pressure, the Joint Trustee and Faculty Committee cut most of the funding for the museum, including the salary of the director, Margaret Brown. Thereafter the museum continued to occupy the same space and produce exhibits, but was run by a faculty committee. Chairmen of the committee included Helen Lockwood and Genieve Lamson. As late as 1952 the museum was still developing exhibits, but the last annual report was submitted in June 1953, and in September 1954 the Faculty Committee on Committees abolished the Committee on the Social
				Museum due to inactivity. </p>
