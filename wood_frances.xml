			<head>Biographical Note </head>
			<p>Frances A. Wood (1840-1914) was an early member of the Vassar College faculty, arriving in 1866 as a music teacher. She later taught English as well, but it was her service as Librarian that had the most profound impact on the college. When Wood took the position in 1880, the Library consisted of a small collection of bound volumes, pamphlets and periodicals housed in close quarters in Main Building. During her 30 year tenure, the collection quadrupled in size, modern cataloging methods were employed, and in 1905 the operation found a new home in the Frederick Ferris Thompson Memorial Library. Wood described the new building as a fantasy fulfilled, a spacious building of "beauty and harmony of arrangement beyond any dream of the early years...." </p>

			<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
